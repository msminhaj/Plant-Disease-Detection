# Plant Disease Detection 
This project leverages deep learning techniques to build a multi-class plant disease detection system using an advanced Inception-based architecture. It aims to aid farmers and agricultural stakeholders in diagnosing plant diseases efficiently and accurately.

## Feature
<li> Multi-Class Classification: Detect multiple plant diseases from a single model.
<li> Deep Learning Backbone: Utilizes the Inception architecture for robust feature extraction.
<li> Efficient Training Pipeline: Optimized for performance and accuracy using modern deep learning techniques.
<li> High Accuracy: Designed to achieve superior classification accuracy across various plant disease categories.

## Used Tools  
<li> Python
<li> TensorFlow/Keras
<li> NumPy
<li> OpenCV for image preprocessing

<li> Kotlin

## Methodology
 # Data Collection and Preprocessing
   Datasets were sourced from open-source repositories or agricultural research centers.
   Images were preprocessed using resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.
 # Model Architecture
   The Inception network was customized to support multi-class classification.
   Transfer learning was employed to fine-tune the model on the dataset for plant diseases.
 # Training and Validation
   The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets.
   The model was trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
 # Evaluation
   Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were computed to evaluate performance.
